    "schema:releaseNotes": "This release add a new subcommand (mcc skeleton) for generating the skeleton of a colored net using TINA's .net format.\n\nCommand mcc hlnet has been replaced with a new command, mcc info, which provides similar functionalities.\n\ncommand mcc pnml now returns models that use \"structured\" place/transition names by default. We also ensure that the XML attributes for place names and IDs are equal. Finally, we added a new option, --properties, which adds traceability information between identifiers in the P/T and COL models. This information is included into the resulting PNML file using a <toolspecific> element.",
